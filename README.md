## First git status output 
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean.


## Second git status output 

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md


## Purpose of the following commands

 - 'mkdir' : the purpose is to create a new directory 
 - 'cd' : is used to change a directory go get all the information, 
          different files and directories 
 - 'code' : automatically open visual code for you from git bash 
 - 'ls' : lists all the files in a specific directory 


 ## Why Version Control is Important 

 With Version Control, it is possible to:
   - Easy Track any changes made to the files and directories. 
   - Enables to user to compare the changes made between the old and new 
     versions and understand it better 
   - The users can collaborate with each other and access, modify and    
     contribute to a project simultaneously without any conflicts, making group works easier. 
   - Mutliple braches can be created where the user can work on it 
     individually and later on merge back into the main project branch 
   - Different users and different branches are enabled to combine 
     changes made in order to resolve conflicts if necessary
   - Version Control servers as a backup system as it stores previous 
     versions files and directories.
   - It helps with compliance with regulatory standards and provides 
     audit trail. 



## Purpose of the following Git Commands 

 - 'git init' : Creates a new Repository.
 - 'git status' : shows the current status of the repository
 - 'git add' : used to save changes made to a file in a git repository
             : also adds the file to the staging area for the next commit 
               to the repository
 - 'git commit' : it records all the staged changes to the repository.
 - 'git push' : it is used to push local changes to the remote repository 
 - 'git pull' : it is used t0 merge and fetch changes from the remote  
                repository to the local repository 
 - 'git log' : used to display the list of all the commits in the
               repository's history
 - 'git branch' : used to create a new branch of the codebase, where the  
                  user can create a new working copy that exits independently of the main branch 
 - 'git merge' : used to combine different branches to one single branch 
 - 'git checkout' : it is used to switch between different branches. 



 ## My Unique Touch 

 There are things that set me apart from others:
  
  - I can watch anime the whole day
  - I work best under pressure 
  - When working, I can multitask and set priorities to my tasks.
