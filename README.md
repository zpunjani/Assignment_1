## First git status output 
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean.


## Second git status output 

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md


## Purpose of the following commands

 -'mkdir' : the purpose is to create a new directory 
 -'cd' : is used to change a directory go get all the information, different files and directories 
 -'code' : automatically open visual code for you from git bash 
 -'ls' : lists all the files in a specific directory 


 ## Why Version Control is Important 

 With Version Control, it is possible to:
   - Easy Track any changes made to the files and directories. 
   - Enables to user to compare the changes made between the old and new versions and understand it better 
   - The users can collaborate with each other and access, modify and    contribute to a project simultaneously without any conflicts, making group works easier. 
   - Mutliple braches can be created where the user can work on it individually and later on merge back into the main project branch 
   - Different users and different branches are enabled to combine changes made in order to resolve conflicts if necessary
   - Version Control servers as a backup system as it stores previous versions files and directories.
   - It helps with compliance with regulatory standards and provides audit trail.
